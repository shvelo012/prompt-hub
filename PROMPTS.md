1. Prompt:
What are the steps to integrate Sequelize with a Next.js project using PostgreSQL?

Project:
Initial database setup and Sequelize integration.

Verification:
AI provided a complete step-by-step guide:

Install necessary packages (sequelize, pg, pg-hstore)

Create and configure a Sequelize instance

Define models using sequelize.define or class-based models

Run migrations

I followed this advice closely. I slightly customized the setup to fit a models/ directory structure. The connection logic worked immediately. I later added error handling around model imports based on AI recommendations.

2. Prompt:
How to convert prompt template string like 'Translate {text} to {language}' into a filled string using provided variables in js?

Project:
Creating the logic for executing a prompt with dynamic variable substitution.

Verification:
AI suggested using a regex with .replace(/{(.*?)}/g, ...). This worked as-is and was implemented. 

3. Prompt:
How to validate that all input variables are filled before making API request?

Project:
Form validation for prompt execution.

Verification:
AI recommended checking for empty string values before submission. I implemented this inside PromptCard's onSubmit handler.

4. Prompt:
How to integrate AI into my project to generate text responses using OpenAI API?

Project:
Implemented AI text generation for prompt execution in BE.

Verification:
The AI integration steps were mostly accurate. I had to adjust the API call structure and error handling to fit my projectâ€™s setup and add loading states for better UX. Overall, the guidance helped me implement the core functionality quickly.

5. Prompt:
What is a good commit message format for feature additions, bug fixes, and refactoring?

Project Part:
Writing concise and descriptive git commit messages following conventional commits style.

Verification:
AI suggested standard prefixes (feat:, fix:, refactor:) which helped keep commits clear. Followed advice consistently.
